Experimenting with AI agents for deep-learning

a) Write an agent from scratch using tools in python: translation_agent.py

Run translation_agent.py and follow the prompts to translate english phrases into your choice of three languages. Uses Bart transformers for translations.

b) Write demonstrations of various agent types with langchain as colab: LangChainAgents.ipynb

Run colab as usual, you will need to use your own OpenAI API key
